  "A schema for messages that we're going to evolve over time"
  ;; Renaming a field combines the techniques to add a field and remove a field
  ;; First let's make the old field name optional, and add a new optional field
  ;; for the new name.
  ;;
  ;; We also need to decide what the application behaviour should be. In this
  ;; case we will:
  ;; * Require at least one of the keys
  ;; * If both keys are passed, accept the new one
  ;; * The output message format will still use `:counter`
  {(s/optional-key :counter) s/Num
   (s/optional-key :counter-value) s/Num
   :increment-by s/Num})
